Dumitru & Cozman (2012) showed that societal evolution yields a complex lifestyle. While we strive to accomplish our bucket list, mental health reflects the anxiety and stress that may have enormous repercussions on our lives (Velten et al., 2014). We focus primarily on our physical health, and psychological health stays less prioritized (Moreno et al., 2020). Hence, the present study focuses on mental health and evaluates the impact of therapeutic interventions to enhance a holistic state of health.
